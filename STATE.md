# Read this first. Everything crucial, in one page.

If context was lost, this file plus `IDEAS.md` is enough to carry on without asking anything.

## The job

Find open OEIS conjectures and prove or disprove them. **Never stop.** Finish an idea, start
the next from `IDEAS.md` without waiting to be asked. Target bulk — hundreds and thousands, not
tens. Mildly harder classes are wanted, not avoided.

## Binding rules

* **Never pad the count.** Two results are distinct when they are on different entries, or the
  entry names them as different conjectures. A g.f. whose denominator IS a recurrence already
  proved for that entry is the same conjecture restated — not a second result.
* **Re-check every result against the LIVE OEIS before counting it** (`src/livenew.py`).
* **Say plainly when something is null, elementary, or probably already known.** A withheld
  result costs nothing; a wrong one costs credibility.
* **Check every apparent disproof by hand against the entry's own wording before recording it.**
  Four times in one day a batch of "disproofs" was a defect in my own reading. Never once a
  false conjecture.
* One PDF per result. Author "Adrian Perez Fontelles, Independent researcher". §1 quotes the
  conjecture verbatim with contributor and date, and states it is still open as of the entry's
  Last-modified line. A Verification section. References. A paper is as long as its result
  needs — no padding, no truncation.
* **NO ZIP ARCHIVES.** Papers in `papers/`, sources in `paper-sources/`, comments in
  `comments/` with the date each result was found, all code and working data under `engine/`.
* Batch notes go to `LEDGER-PENDING.md`; a daily routine folds them into `LEDGER.md`.
* Nothing is ever posted to the OEIS. That is the user's to do.

## The habit that has found every large vein

**Read what a sweep REFUSES, not what it proves.** A sweep reporting a small clean number is
not evidence that the pool is small. Every large vein so far was reachable by machinery already
built and hidden by how a sweep chose what to look at — never by mathematics.

Recurring defects, all found this way:

1. a pool built from a stale snapshot (seven times, 40–1,718 entries each)
2. requiring the conjectural word ON the line, so block conjectures are invisible — found in
   the pool filter, in every sweep, and in the live re-check, where it was destroying results
3. skipping an entry without recording the skip, so every run re-reads the same early index
4. no clock, so one slow entry eats the whole run
5. a formula split across continuation lines, read truncated
6. a threshold scan starting one index late
7. a claim's qualifier dropped ("for odd n")
8. **an instrument that cannot see what it is asked about returns a confident zero** — test any
   instrument on a case whose answer is known before trusting its number
9. comparing a conjecture against regenerated terms instead of the entry's own data — the
   entry's published data is the ground truth; the recurrence only carries a claim beyond it

## Where things stand

* **12,012 papers installed** (11,791 proofs + 6 disproofs at last ranking; counts are
  re-derived by `src/sync_counts.py`, never typed by hand).
* Held and awaiting install: the generating-function vein (2,151 proved), plus tables,
  min-filter, words, cusp forms, CA rows, second conjectures, e.g.f.s.
* **19,097 OEIS entries carry a conjectured recurrence with no linked proof.** 32,629 carry a
  conjecture of any recognised kind. That is the ceiling this project works against.

## Every session, first three commands

```
cd /home/user/Conjectures/engine && sh src/restart_all.sh     # brings every sweep back
python3 src/merge_sharded.py                                  # fold shard progress in
python3 src/status.py                                         # one line, where everything is
```

Background jobs only get CPU while a foreground command runs, so keep a useful foreground
command going. A source fix does NOT reach a process already running — restart it.

## Installing a batch

`newlist.py` → `livenew.py` (live re-check) → the vein's builder → `install_vein.py` →
`rank.py` → `makeindex.py` → `sync_sources.py` → `sync_counts.py` → `addtexfacts_all.py` →
`mkcomments.py` → `paperdates.py` → `makecomments_site.py` → commit and push to
`claude/code-setup-guidance-xit8fk`.

`rank.py`, `sync_sources.py` and `paperdates.py` refuse to run twice at once. Never start a
second copy.
