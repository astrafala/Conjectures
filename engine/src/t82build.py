"""One paper per entry settled by transfer82.

What these have in common is a condition on every subblock, or on every pair of neighbouring
subblocks, and what differs is the condition, the shape and --- for a few of them --- a
scaling factor in front of the count. The general builder would describe all of that as "a
bounded window of consecutive lines", which is true but says nothing about the entry in
hand, and would drop the scaling factor entirely.

\title{{A condition on every subblock: the empirical recurrence for OEIS {a}}}

\maketitle

\begin{{abstract}}
OEIS {a} carries an empirical recurrence of order ${order}$ contributed by R.~H.~Hardin. It is
true, and it is decidable rather than empirical. The entry's condition is a condition on every
subblock of a fixed size, so it is decided by a bounded window of consecutive lines; the
admissible windows are the vertices of a finite digraph and the arrays counted are exactly the
walks in it. Hence $a(n)$ is a walk count on $S={S}$ vertices and is $C$-finite, and whether the
conjectured recurrence annihilates it is settled by a finite exact computation, with the
Cayley--Hamilton theorem bounding the work.{scale}

\section{{The conjecture}}

OEIS {a} is ``{esc(e['name'].strip())}''. It has offset ${off}$ and begins
\[
{", ".join(str(x) for x in d[:8])},\ \dots
\]
The entry states, as a conjecture contributed by its author and never marked settled:
\begin{{quote}}
{esc(conj) if conj else '(the empirical recurrence quoted in the entry)'}
\end{{quote}}
As of the ``Last modified'' line on the live entry ({mod}, revision {rev}) this is still
recorded as empirical, and nothing on the entry records it as proved.

{model_section(p, S, expo)}
\[
a(n)\;=\;{pref}\iota^{{\!\top}}M^{{\,{expo}}}\tau ,
\]
the exponent fixed by the entry's own shape and checked against its published terms. In
particular $a$ is $C$-finite.

\section{{The proof}}

\begin{{lemma}}\label{{lem:crit}}
Let $q(t)=t^{{{order}}}-\sum_i c_it^{{{order}-i}}$ be the characteristic polynomial of the
conjectured recurrence. The residual $a(n)-\sum_ic_ia(n-i)$ equals
$\iota^{{\!\top}}M^{{\,j}}q(M)\tau$ for the corresponding walk index $j$, so the recurrence
holds from some point on if and only if $\iota^{{\!\top}}M^{{j}}q(M)\tau=0$ for all large $j$,
and it is enough to examine $j<S$.
\end{{lemma}}

\begin{{proof}}
Factor $M^{{j}}$ out of $M^{{j+{order}}}-\sum_ic_iM^{{j+{order}-i}}$. For the bound, $M^{{S}}$
is an integer combination of $I,M,\dots,M^{{S-1}}$ by Cayley--Hamilton, so the numbers
$u_j=\iota^{{\!\top}}M^{{j}}q(M)\tau$ obey the monic recurrence given by the characteristic
polynomial of $M$; $S$ consecutive zeros force every later one, and the last nonzero $u_j$
pins the threshold exactly. A constant factor in front of $a$ divides out of the residual and
changes nothing here.
\end{{proof}}

\begin{{theorem}}
\[
a(n)\;=\;{rec_tex(coeffs)}
\]
for every $n>{nthr}$.
\end{{theorem}}

\begin{{proof}}
The vector $w=q(M)\tau$ was formed by ${order}$ matrix--vector products in exact integer
arithmetic and $\iota^{{\!\top}}M^{{j}}w$ evaluated for $j=0,1,\dots$, again exactly; those
integers vanish from the index corresponding to $n={nthr}+1$ onwards and the run continued
until the working vector was identically zero, which settles every larger $j$ at once.{tight}
\end{{proof}}

\section{{Verification}}

Four checks, each independent of the algebra above.

First, the model reproduces all ${nterms}$ terms the entry publishes, exactly, in integer
arithmetic. This is what ties the model to the entry: the digraph is built by reading the
entry's English, and a misreading gives different counts.

Second, the reading was pinned before the digraph was written, by a program that enumerates
every array of the given shape one by one and tests the entry's condition on each subblock
directly. That program shares no code with the transfer matrix, so an error in one does not
hide an error in the other.

Third, the conjectured recurrence was evaluated directly on the published terms, with no
matrices involved, and holds wherever the proved range and the data overlap.

Fourth, the annihilation test of Lemma~\ref{{lem:crit}} was carried out in exact integer
arithmetic on the whole vector rather than on a sampled prefix.
