# IDLE BACKOFF (defect 44). A round of this loop that finds work takes minutes -- BUDGET
# alone is 90 seconds or more -- so a round that returns in seconds found nothing, and the
# only thing relaunching it achieves is another interpreter start. Thirteen veins were doing
# exactly that at once: /tmp was wiped by a container restart at 02:00 and by 02:05 the runner
# logs held about twenty-five thousand lines, almost all of them the empty result dict, while
# Phase 5 -- the one job with 1,904 entries of real work left -- wrote nothing for an hour.
# Reading the clock needs nothing from the sweep and so works for every script below, not just
# sweep_shard. Stopping is not retirement: restart_all.sh relaunches this an hour from now,
# which is when a changed engine could have reopened the vein.
